It translates CryptoCurrency 🤑  into USD💰!

After a lengthy hibernation period, it looks like cryptocurrencies are back on the rise. 
So I thought it would be fun to build a cryptocurrency portfolio calculator to help me prepare for the ensuing emotional rollercoaster that is surely on the horizon.

We are going to use react js and CoinGecko API to build our own cryptocurrency portfolio app.

How It Will Work😮‍💨 ? 
The user will input which coin they purchased, a buy date, a sell date, and the amount of tokens they purchased. The calculator will return their total gains or losses
